# Arduino Micro based led cube

This project is a 4x4x4 led cube, inspired by the 4x4x4 LED Cube (Arduino Uno) by KyleTheCreator
https://www.instructables.com/4x4x4-LED-Cube-Arduino-Uno/

Hardware differences 
* Arduino Micro
* Different pinout
* The LEDs are connected the opposite way

This code is a direct adaptation of the original code to work with our variant of the cube
